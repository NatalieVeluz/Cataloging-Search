But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer–but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code–lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code–of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.','Computers',NULL,'Google Books','2008',NULL,'Pearson Education'),(65,'9780135781999','Clean Agile','Robert C.

As artificial intelligence evolves from simple reactive programs to autonomous entities capable of understanding context and making complex decisions, this book provides the essential Design Patterns and proven techniques needed to construct intelligent systems effectively. Each of the 21 Design Patterns represents a fundamental building block for creating agents that can perceive their environment, make informed decisions, and execute actions autonomously. Agentic Design Patterns: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems is structured as a comprehensive hands-on guide, with each chapter dedicated to a single agentic pattern. Within each chapter, you will find a detailed pattern overview, practical applications and use cases, one or more hands-on code example, and key takeaways for quick review. From foundational concepts such as Prompt Chaining and Tool Use to advanced topics like Multi-Agent Collaboration and Self-Correction, readers will gain practical knowledge they can immediately apply. While the chapters build on each other, you can also use the book as a handy reference, jumping to patterns that address your specific challenges. To provide a tangible \"canvas\" for the code examples, this guide utilizes three prominent agent development frameworks: LangChain and its extension LangGraph, which offer a flexible way to build complex operational sequences; Crew AI, which provides a structured framework for orchestrating multiple agents; and the Google Agent Developer Kit (Google ADK), which offers tools for building, evaluating, and deploying agents. By showcasing examples across these tools, you will gain a broad understanding of how these patterns can be applied in any technical environment. Building effective agentic systems requires more than just a powerful language model; it demands structure and design. Agentic patterns provide reusable, battle-tested solutions to common challenges, much like design patterns in software engineering. They offer a common language that makes an agent\'s logic clearer, more maintainable, and more robust. By the end of this journey, you will possess both the theoretical understanding and the practical skills to implement these 21 essential patterns, enabling you to build more intelligent, capable, and autonomous systems on your chosen development canvas.','Computers',NULL,'Multiple Sources','2025',NULL,'Springer Nature'),(79,'9780132928472','The Robert C.

The role of designers in indirectly supporting the promotion of healthy lifestyles or in their contribution to illbeing has emerged. This means designers now need to consider, both morally and ethically, how they can ensure that they ‘do no harm’ and that they might deliberately decide to promote healthy lifestyles and therefore prevent ill health. Design for Health illustrates the history of the development of design for health, the various design disciplines and domains to which design has contributed. Through 26 case studies presented in this book, the authors reveal a plethora of design research methodologies and research methods employed in design for health.

In order to survive in times of growing online retail, brick-and-mortar retailers must become aware of their unique potential to address non-digitizable consumer needs and transform retail environments into places of experience and discovery. A key building block for achieving this aim lies in the creation of sensory experiences that motivate consumers to enter and linger in stationary retail environments. But how?

Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious -- even liberating -- book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how -- and why -- some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.','Design',NULL,'Google Books','2013',NULL,'Hachette UK'),(99,'0691122253','Success Through Failure','Henry Petroski','Not Assigned by LOC','H123','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o1yPfO6bwegC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','This book examines the importance of engineering design as well as society\'s ability to respond to design flaws.','Science',NULL,'Google Books','2006',NULL,'Princeton University Press'),(100,'9780071629225','Universal Design Handbook, 2E','Wolfgang Preiser','Not Assigned by LOC','W123','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=riLXHAO9Zt4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','The Latest Advances in Universal Design Thoroughly updated and packed with examples of global standards and design solutions, Universal Design Handbook, Second Edition, covers the full scope of universal design, discussing how to develop media, products, buildings, and infrastructure for the widest range of human needs, preferences, and functioning.

Keeping skin healthy is a booming industry, and yet it seems like almost no one agrees on what actually works. Confusing messages from health authorities and ineffective treatments have left many people desperate for reliable solutions. An enormous alternative industry is filling the void, selling products that are often of questionable safety and totally unknown effectiveness. In Clean, doctor and journalist James Hamblin explores how we got here, examining the science and culture of how we care for our skin today. He talks to dermatologists, microbiologists, allergists, immunologists, aestheticians, bar-soap enthusiasts, venture capitalists, Amish people, theologians, and straight-up scam artists, trying to figure out what it really means to be clean. He even experiments with giving up showers entirely, and discovers that he is not alone. Along the way, he realizes that most of our standards of cleanliness are less related to health than most people think. A major part of the picture has been missing: a little-known ecosystem known as the skin microbiome—the trillions of microbes that live on our skin and in our pores. These microbes are not dangerous; they’re more like an outer layer of skin that no one knew we had, and they influence everything from acne, eczema, and dry skin, to how we smell. The new goal of skin care will be to cultivate a healthy biome—and to embrace the meaning of “clean” in the natural sense. This can mean doing much less, saving time, money, energy, water, and plastic bottles in the process. Lucid, accessible, and deeply researched, Clean explores the ongoing, radical change in the way we think about our skin, introducing readers to the emerging science that will be at the forefront of health and wellness conversations in coming years.','Health & Fitness',NULL,'Google Books','2020',NULL,'Penguin'),(112,'0736809740','Keep Clean','Katie Bagley','Not Assigned by LOC','K123','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zaO5sW3OZEoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','\"An introduction to hygiene, including germs, head lice, wearing clean clothes, and the importance of washing the body, hands, and hair\"--T.p. verso.','Juvenile Nonfiction',NULL,'Google Books','2002',NULL,'Capstone'),(113,'9780736949880','The House That Cleans Itself','Mindy Starns Clark','Not Assigned by LOC','M123','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ae6EAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','The ultimate guide for the housekeeping-impaired!

[this] endearing history of Western cleanliness holds a welcome mirror up to our intimate selves.\" — Publishers Weekly The question of cleanliness is one every age and culture has answered with confidence. For the first-century Roman, being clean meant a two-hour soak in baths of various temperatures, scraping the body with a miniature rake, and a final application of oil. For the aristocratic Frenchman in the seventeenth century, it meant changing your shirt once a day and perhaps going so far as to dip your hands in some water. Did Napoleon know something we didn\'t when he wrote Josephine \"I will return in five days. Stop washing\"? And why is the German term Warmduscher—a man who washes in warm or hot water—invariably a slight against his masculinity? Katherine Ashenburg takes on such fascinating questions as these in Dirt on Clean, her charming tour of attitudes to hygiene through time. An engrossing fusion of erudition and anecdote, Dirt on Clean considers the bizarre prescriptions of history\'s doctors, the hygienic peccadilloes of great authors, and the historic twists and turns that have brought us to a place Ashenburg considers hedonistic yet oversanitized. \"Fascinating.\" — School Library Journal \"Dozens of charming illustrations distinguish a book notable for its engaging design as well as its illuminating content.\" — Kirkus Reviews','History',NULL,'Google Books','2014',NULL,'Macmillan + ORM'),(115,'9780199532087','Clean','Virginia Sarah Smith','Not Assigned by LOC','V123','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4bsUDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','From pre-historic grooming rituals to New Age medicine, from ascetics to cosmetics, Clean looks at how different cultures have interpreted and striven for personal cleanliness and shows how, throughout history, this striving for purity has brought immense social benefits as well as great tragedies. Looking at human history through the lens of public baths, lavatories, laundry, teeth cleaning, cosmetics, food storage and panty liners, Virginia Smith here combines archeology, psychology, biology, and other fields to illuminate our modern obsession cleanliness. She peppers her entertaining account with engaging and often surprising details. The book reveals, for instance, that even at the earliest stages of human development, our bodies produced pleasure-giving chemical opiates when things smelled or felt clean, inducing us to bathe or at least remove dirty clothes. She describes how, during the Bronze Age, an emerging hierarchy of wealthy elites turned their love of grooming into an explosion of the cosmetic and luxury goods industry, greatly affecting the culture and economy of Eurasia and leading to advances in chemistry and medicine. Likewise, in Greece and Rome, citizens focused much of their leisure time on perfecting, bathing, or just writing about the model athletic body. Even today, our enlightened medical knowledge could not stop an onslaught of health remedies, treatments, spas, and New Age nature cures--all in the pursuit of purity.

The cautious emancipation of the late middle ages and the revolutionary creation of the new science in the 16th century are not conceivable without reference to the Almagest. This text lifted European astronomy to the high standard of knowledge on which the new science flourished.

Caught between the world of the Jedi, the ancient responsibilities of his lost home, and the alluring power of the relics, Dooku struggles to stay in the light—even as the darkness begins to fall.','Fiction',NULL,'Google Books','2019',NULL,'Random House Worlds'),(123,'9781302530051','Star Wars','Timothy Zahn','Not Assigned by LOC','T123','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oBkNEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','Return to the saga of Grand Admiral Thrawn with the comic-book adaptation of the hit novel! As rivals for the Emperor\'s favor, Grand Admiral Thrawn and Darth Vader may seem like unlikely partners for a crucial mission! Yet this formidable twosome has worked together before. Years ago, Thrawn and the man once known as Anakin Skywalker were joined in the hunt for Padmé Amidala. Now, as each man carves his own way through the galaxy, they will find themselves bound together once more by the Emperor\'s will - and they will each be tested to their limits by an enemy worthy of their formidable combined might! Darth Vader and Thrawn must find the solution to their problem, but where does that leave Thrawn and Anakin?

The reader is taken on an odyssey, beginning with \"The Schooner Flight,\" in which a poor mulatto sailor abandons his life in Trinidad, sailing northward to meet his fate, and ending with \"The Star-Apple Kingdom,\" a long poem whose axis is the crucial attempt to establish a new social order in Jamaica without sacrificing democracy. Other poems speak through various personae: \"Koenig of the River\" marks the end of a saga of nineteenth-century exploration and conquest through the Conradian image of a missionary-soldier whose comrades have been lost at sea; \"The Saddhu of Couva\" describes the lament of an Indian priest for a fading spirituality; \"Egypt, Tobago\" places Mark Antony on a beach in the glare of afternoon. Two poems are dedicated to fellow poets--Josephy Brodsky and Robert Lowell. In The Star-Apple Kingdom, Walcott\'s precise and inventive imagery is enriched by frequent exploitation of the tonal aspects of dialect. He has absorbed into poetry the normal resources of fiction--to the point where fact crystallizes into metaphor. As John Thompson recently commented in The New York Review of Books: \"Walcott writes now as a man who knows exactly what he is doing. His style is that of the best language of our period.\"','Poetry',NULL,'Google Books','2025',NULL,'Macmillan + ORM'),(125,'9780521173636','The Cambridge Star Atlas','Wil Tirion','Not Assigned by LOC','W123','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k2GiRwnAl9cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','Ideal for astronomers worldwide, the fourth edition of this classic atlas features new Moon maps, new data and enhanced charts.','Nature',NULL,'Google Books','2011',NULL,'Cambridge University Press');
